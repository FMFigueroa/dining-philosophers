# Dining Philosophers

### Problem
<p align="justify">In ancient times, a wealthy philanthropist set up a university to accommodate five eminent philosophers. Each philosopher had a room in which they could carry out their professional activity of thinking. There was also a common dining room furnished with a circular table surrounded by five chairs, each one identified with the name of the philosopher who sat in it. The philosophers sat counterclockwise around the table. To the left of each philosopher lay a golden fork, and in the center, a bowl of spaghetti, which was constantly refilled. It was expected that a philosopher would spend most of their time thinking. However, when they felt hungry, they would go to the dining room, take the fork to their left and immerse it in the spaghetti. But the spaghetti was so tangled in nature that a second fork was required to bring it to the mouth. The philosopher, therefore, had to also take the fork to their right. When they finished, they had to put down both forks, get up from the chair, and resume thinking. Of course, a fork can be used by only one philosopher at a time. If another philosopher wishes to use it, they must wait until the fork is available again.</p>

<p align="justify">Only two philosophers can eat at any given time and consequently the output will look like this:</p>
